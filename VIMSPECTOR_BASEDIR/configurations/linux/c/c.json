/* Basic configurations for debugging with Vimspector
 *  
 *   NOTE: C/C++ style comments are allowed here since Vimspector
 *         will remove them before parsing the json file
 *
 *   This contains basic configurations for debugging local/remote
 *   python/C programs.
 *
 *   1. C - gdb      : debug local C code
 *   2. C Remote     : debug remote C code
 *    
 *
 *   Debugging chain:
 *   Vim -> Vimspector plugin -> specific-language adapter -> specific-language debugger -> binary (or attach to remote server)
 *          |                    |                            |                             |
 *          |                    |                            |                             \_ File to debug
 *          |                    |                            \_ native debugger (ie: gdb)
 *          |                    \_ DAP to native-language debugger (ie: vscode-cpptools)
 *          |                       Yes.. Vimspector takes advantage of the Vscode adapters.
 *          |                       
 *          \_ Visual debugging support (windows for code/variables/..) and DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol from Microsoft) support
 *
 *   DAP is a language-agnostic debug protocol, which of course, is not supported by any debugger :), so DAP-debugger adapters are
 *   needed in order to complete the chain. In the end, you'll be using the usual debugger under the hood. You can even execute regular
 *   native commands if you need to (ie: (for gdb) -exec p i)
 *
 *   For remote debugging, you need, of course, to launch the debugger server (ie: gdb-server, debugpy, ...). You can automate this process
 *   inside the adapter configuration (by connecting using PASSWORDLESS ssh and running the server in the remote machine). 
 *   In the next configurations, it is assumed that you manually enter the remote machine and launch the debugger server. I don't quite
 *   like to be Forced to use passwordless ssh to automate this task (anyway configure it is very easy).
